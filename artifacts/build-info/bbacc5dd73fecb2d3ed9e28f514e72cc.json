Note that any function without this setup won't be\n * effectively restricted.\n *\n * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\n * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n *\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n *\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n *\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n *\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n *\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n *\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\n * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\n *\n * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\n * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\n * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\n * registered in the {AccessManager}.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n *\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n * reused.

@dev AccessManager is a central contract to store the permissions of a system.\n A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the\n {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted}\n modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be\n effectively restricted.\n The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\n by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\n the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\n NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\n {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\n Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\n registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions\n will be {AccessManager} itself.\n WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very\n mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or\n {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":2351,"linearizedBaseContracts":[2351,3943,3038,2966,2605],"name":"AccessManagerUpgradeable","nameLocation":"3974:24:1","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"global":false,"id":276,"libraryName":{"id":275,"name":"Time","nameLocations":["4086:4:1"],"nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":8119,"src":"4086:4:1"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"4080:17:1"},{"canonicalName":"AccessManagerUpgradeable.TargetConfig","id":286,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":280,"mutability":"mutable","name":"allowedRoles","nameLocation":"4239:12:1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":286,"src":"4197:54:1","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_bytes4_$_t_uint64_$","typeString":"mapping(bytes4

@dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed\n behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

is a central contract to store the permissions of a system. A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted} modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be effectively restricted. The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \\\"roles\\\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}). For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay: * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}. * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact. * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}. By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise. Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins: * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles. * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations. * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}. * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}. * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}. Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}). Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO). NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface. NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}. Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions will be {AccessManager} itself. WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.\",\"errors\":{\"AddressEmptyCode(address)\":[{\"details\":\"There's no code at `target` (it is not a contract).\"}],\"AddressInsufficientBalance(address)\":[{\"details\":\"The ETH balance of the account is not enough to perform the operation.\"}],\"FailedInnerCall()\":[{\"details\":\"A call to an address target failed.

If the call is subject to a previously set delay (not zero), then the function should return false and the caller should schedule the operation for future execution. If `immediate` is true, the delay can be disregarded and the operation can be immediately executed, otherwise the operation can be executed if and only if delay is greater than 0. NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument. In that case they will fail to identify the indirect workflow, and will consider calls that require a delay to be forbidden.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

The user will only be able to execute the operation after the delay has passed, before it has expired. During this period, admin and guardians can cancel the operation (see {cancel}). If the account has already been granted this role, the execution delay will be updated. This update is not immediate and follows the delay rules.

This returns the storage slot used by the implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier.\"},\"renounceRole(uint64,address)\":{\"details\":\"Renounce role permissions for the calling account with immediate effect.

It is possible to choose the timestamp at which the operation becomes executable as long as it satisfies the execution delays required for the caller. The special value zero will automatically set the earliest possible time. Returns the `operationId` that was scheduled. Since this value is a hash of the parameters, it can reoccur when the same parameters are used; if this is relevant, the returned `nonce` can be used to uniquely identify this scheduled operation from other occurrences of the same `operationId` in invocations of {execute} and {cancel}. Emits a {OperationScheduled} event. NOTE: It is not possible to concurrently schedule more than one operation with the same `target` and `data`. If this is necessary, a random byte can be appended to `data` to act as a salt that will be ignored by the target contract if it is using standard Solidity ABI encoding.\"},\"setGrantDelay(uint64,uint32)\":{\"details\":\"Update the delay for granting a `roleId`.
